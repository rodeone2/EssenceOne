        <h3>You Build It !</h3>
        <p>
          With EssenceOne we leave the fun stuf for you to do. With the Single Model Indexer you really wont need much else. The Model Structure and Module system is easily layed out. Now all you need to do is start building Views(page-parts) and Controllers(classes and functions). Then adding them into the list for the config and adding them to the indexer model.
        </p>
        <h4>Adding A Template</h4>
        <p>When and if choosing a different template just remember to break them down into as many sections or changeable views that you will need. There is no limit. The same with controllers. You may end up with tiny sections that may require a single function call, but thats ok. At least EssenceOne shows in detail what is going on and where. Unlike other Frameworks there is no guesswork involved.</p>
        <h4>Adding A Module</h4>
        <p>Adding additional Modules is just as easy. It is Alphanumeric. Simply add the next numbered order to your c controllers v views r resources etc and run with it. The Module separation could not be any simpler. Lets say you wish to add a storefront application. Then lets build it. Add the changed section page-part views and name them as you choose and place them into the numeric order for that added Module. Lets say it is 5. So then we create our file system as c5, v5, r5, s5, a5 etc. Then start building. You may need several different page parts too. So lets have 4 different leftmenu sections. Simply name all 4 within the v5 folder as our Storefront App's leftmenu views that will change within it from page to page. For instance we could name them-->left_store1.php, left_store2.php, left_store3.php and left_store4.php. The same goes with the different content or page sections as well. </p>
