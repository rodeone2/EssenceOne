          The single model indexer controls everything within a simple list of files, views and controllers in a alphanumeric order. You simply break down your template into sections and page-parts and list them by name in the indexer list and that is it. Modules are separated by alphanumeric file orders which strt out with three modules. Public(static), protected(members) and private(admin) plus you can add more easily.
